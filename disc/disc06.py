'''Mutability
Some objects in Python, such as lists and dictionaries, are mutable, meaning 
that their contents or state can be changed. 

Other objects, such as numeric types, tuples, and strings, are immutable, meaning 
they cannot be changed once they are created.

extend(lst): Extend the list by concatenating it with lst. Return None.
